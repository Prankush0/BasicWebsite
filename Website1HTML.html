            More than any one sight, it's the city itself that enchants visitors.
            It's a sprawling, organic thing, stretching as far as the eye can see. 
            Always changing, and with a diverse collection of neighborhoods, 
            no two experiences of the city are ever the same. 
            Some neighborhoods feel like a vision from the future, 
            with ever taller, sleeker structures popping up each year; 
            others evoke the past with low-slung wooden buildings and 
            glowing lanterns radiating surprising warmth; elsewhere, 
            drab concrete blocks hide art galleries and cocktail bars 
            and every lane hints at possible discoveries.
